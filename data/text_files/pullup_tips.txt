For better pull ups, treat each rep like a clean skill, not a struggle. Start by owning the dead hang with shoulders “packed” down and back, then initiate by pulling your elbows toward your ribs instead of yanking with your arms. Keep your body tight like a plank, squeeze glutes and abs, and avoid swinging by crossing your feet slightly in front. Think “chest to bar” and lead with your sternum, not your chin. Use a full range of motion, control the lower (the eccentric) for 2–3 seconds, and stop the set when form breaks. If you’re building strength, practice scapular pull ups, slow negatives, and band-assisted reps, and prioritize consistency over maxing out.

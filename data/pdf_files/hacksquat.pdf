For a solid hack squat, set your feet first: a little higher on the platform usually feels more knee-friendly and hits more glutes, while lower hits more quads. Keep your whole foot planted and drive through midfoot, not just your toes. Use the sled to guide you, but don’t relax at the bottom: keep your core braced, ribs down, and your lower back gently pressed into the pad the whole time. Descend under control until your thighs are at least parallel (or as deep as your hips allow without your pelvis tucking), then push up while keeping your knees tracking over your toes, not caving in. Think “sit down between my heels, then stand up through the floor,” and avoid locking out hard so your quads stay loaded.
